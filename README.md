# Ancestor's Wisdom

*In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings...*

Ancestor's Wisdom is a simple Flutter app that displays a random quote from the Ancestor. It was inspired by the Quotes app from the Flutter & Dart - The Complete Flutter App Development Course by Paulo Dichone on Udemy.
